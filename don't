I can follow your video but 
I still don't get how the thing works. 
This is not a poem like you said in your video. 
Just typing some words to fill in some blank space 
To see if I was able to understand a bit what you 
where trying to explain about the git and github in your video series. 
ps: Don't mind my typo fault of mistake. 
Thanks any way
