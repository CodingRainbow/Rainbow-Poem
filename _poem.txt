Hold fast to dreams

For if dreams die

Life is a broken-winged bird

That cannot fly. 

Hold fast to dreams

For when dreams go

Life is a barren field

Frozen with snow. 



Go after dreams

for when dreams expire

life wears you down

till your flat as a tire.

Quick addition I thought of lol (practicing pull requests)
