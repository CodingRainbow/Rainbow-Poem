Virus Or Antivirus

The World is Facing a Virus
Mans life is tedious
Humans are locked in home
So all the other creatures can find their home.
We as a species are dying
But Nature is enjoying
If you want to live 
Let not your house be leave
Wash your hand
and dont touch another one.
I have time infinite
So I have come here to revive
All you be garteful to the antivirus of nature
Pay your respect to one another
