Caruaru is a city in the Northeast of Brazil.
It is full of popular culture and in all days of June happens a big festival called "Festas Juninas" or just "São João".
People come from every state even from countries outside of Brazil.

Singing and poetry contest, "repente" and "forró" music style and lots of dancing.
Local market gets heated and local economy increases. 

Can you think about a city that moves native people (and from nearby cities) to change their routine selling tipical foods like
"canjica", "milho assado", "milho cozinhado", "pé-de-moleque", "munguzá", "tapioca", "cuscuz" and much, much, much more!

Also, people rent their houses to foreigners for about 30 days and get some extra money.

In addition to food, the festival has several musical presentations where local and outside artists 
and bands perform for about 2 hours each. This happens about 20 of 30 days.

The most important day is the June, 24th, Day of "São João".
The second and third most important days of this festival are the June, 13th, the day of "Santo Antônio" and the June, 29th, day of "São Pedro".

Typical dancing and food, several "the biggest (food)..." culture, shows, local market, crafts (one of the biggest in the world), museums 
and, not less important, a welcoming people.

Come here in June and enjoy the June Festival in Caruaru. The biggest "São João" in this whole world!
