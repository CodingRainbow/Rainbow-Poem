It's spring now here in Jiangnan University Wuxi.
The weather is pretty facinating
And just now i have watched shiffman's videos on how to use github on bilibili.com
I think his vedios are pretty good
And now i basically understand how to use it.
Anyway,Thanks for his videos
Coding continuing...
国外的小伙伴，你们吼呀
所以我不会是第一个在这留言的Chinese吧

二楼我来了，下面送上“赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，谁持彩练当空舞“的翻译...
Red, orange, yellow, flying in the sky,
green, blue and purple, who is it that carries
with this imagined flight!

Spring is good.
And i love coding.
哈哈，我来了

最上面在bilibili看的兄弟
shiffman看了后估计一口老血喷到屏幕上
自己的视频怎么跑到一个从来都没有听说过的网站去了
