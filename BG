Here is another test :)
And here is another one xD

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment â€˜s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding

what a colorful rainbow
so appeling in the sky
its appearance worhth a smile
coloured with several elegent colours
placed so up high in the sky
