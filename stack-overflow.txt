I fly like a butterfly, fluttering in the air.
But when all seems lost, I find a way.
From the help of others, I rise again.
Stack Overflow, here at our rescue!

//This is so true when programming. I almost always never do it without accessing stack overflow once.
//Thank you to the wonderful human beings who continuously help other struggling human beings!
