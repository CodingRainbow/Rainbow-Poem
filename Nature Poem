Nature is what we see —
The Hill — the Afternoon —
Squirrel — Eclipse — the Bumble Bee —
Nay — Nature is Heaven —
Nature is what we hear —
The Bobolink — the Sea —
Thunder — the Cricket —
Nay — Nature is Harmony —
Nature is what we know —
Yet have no Art to say —
So impotent our Wisdom is
To Her Simplicity
