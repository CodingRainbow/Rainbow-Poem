# Appreciation poem

=====

## Love your videos, keep it up.

Roses are... _delicate_, and violets are too,  
This is a poem, of my appreciation for you.

As I sit here, making up these rhymes,  
In my mind I'm thinking,  
whether this repo is still ticking,  
in these uncertain times.

Logic will say no, but my hope's still up,  
Because RainbowCoder, you're cool as...  
Fiercely pouring floods, from a waterfall  
But this has been my poem, and I hope you all,  
Enjoyed it's silliness, even though it's small.

Love your videos and love what you do for the people interestd in computers, appreciate ya'!
