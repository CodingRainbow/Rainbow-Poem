Hello!
This is just a test to see the capabilities of forking. Yes, here it is.  
Anti's Wonderful World of Wonder
What do you wish to seek?
I wish for knowledge.
For how much knowledge?
For all knowledge.
That is an impossible endeavour.
And yet I shall strive and strive and gain as much knowledge as I may.
How do you propose to do such a preposterously impossible task?

Through the powers of the internet, the information of free things, of varied quality, low and high, all throughout. There are gems in this 'internet', whether it be Coding Train, or Science Asylum to ProfRobBob, whose contents are great, yet are very little known. Of course there are the larger ones, from Kurzgesagt to MinutePhysics, Veritasium, PhysicsGirl, Vsauce, and all the rest. But there is something intriguing about the channels that seem not to have reached their equilibrium of quality-viewership, for their quality is great, yet their viewership not so. 
I see.
But despite this imbalance, they still push and push for greater content, for that is all one can do.
And we appreciate that.
Yes we do.
