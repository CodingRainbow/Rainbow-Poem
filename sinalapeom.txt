The Water Buffalo

My beard on fire

in haste, I was running, running down in the dawn,

bearing the burdens of life

all on my back;

at the edge of the road, in a large clump of grass

like a fat merchant spread eagled on his easy-chair

I saw you lie.

Both eyes closed;

and at the earth-shattering

battering of my feet

you did not even start.

Ears turned down;

my sky-thundering

lightning-like haste

did not surprise you.

Teeth unbrushed

face unwashed,

in the mountain’s moist lap

of lush marsh grass

mud splashed.

What if, like you

I too

could laze?

Tell me my buffalo,

you who can’t even stand

yes you, Reverend Sir!

Are you observing rites,

contemplating the impermanence of life,

belching with both eyes closed?

Or do you count beads

with each slow puff

of dilated nostril?

Like eye-flies slowly crawling

from a partly opened flower

are the thoughts that seem to teem

from those faintly twitching eyes;

what secret do they hold?

Head half-lifted up

spit drooling, lips that chap

like a toothless mouth chewing betel

all alone;

a lazy past was yours.

The full weight of earth and sky

bundled in one load

like a wisp of a cotton flake

you bear

on those handsome, upturned horns.

How do you do it

O buffalo?

You do not know of yesterday

nor have yet come to know today.

Tomorrow you know nothing of.

Undying time alone is yours.

You are my only idol

all in stone.
