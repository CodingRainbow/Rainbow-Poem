Pete the Greek

Years ago,
When I first rode Pete, his owner said 
He won the Santa Anita
In a minute and forty-seven seconds.

       “He would’ve kept winning
        If his leg hadn’t broken.”

In the afternoon’s haze,
Pete’s hooves touch the ground
Like a dancer’s toes and his gallop blurs the field
Into watercolor strokes.
The reins fall away and I clench
His mane –almost flying–

A few years from now,
Pete’s leg will go lame
And his owner will say
     
      “He’s just too expensive.”

Standing in his stall,
Pete will chew carrots and sugar cubes
As poison rushes to his heart
In a minute and forty-seven seconds.
