Perspective on Pollution

Rainbow colors on the water's surface
Look so beautiful when you see them up close.
But step back from that rainbow and you'll see
It's really an ugly oil slick fouling a once pristine shore.


A Choking Sky

Watching smoke stacks choke the sky
Always makes me want to cry.
I just can't help but wonder why
The factories won't even try
To find a safer, better way
To put their poisonous waste away.


Glimpse of a Polluted Future

Where are the birds that used to dot the sky?
They're not here anymore, and I have to wonder why.

Where are the fish that used to swim in this stream?
I can't see them anymore. What does that mean?

Where are the frogs that used to croak around this lake?
I can't hear them anymore. There must be some mistake.

I wish there was a clock whose hands I could rewind.
We might have saved these creatures if we'd just had more time.

Time to make people see how we're damaging our Earth,
Time to realize what it all was truly worth.

But the animals are disappearing at an alarming rate.
If we don't finally band together, it may really be too late.
