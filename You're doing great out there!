“You’re doing GREAT out there!” I exclaim with as much enthusiasm as I can this late in the day. 
The scraggly vegan is the only one left in the tavern, his attention focused entirely on the card 
game we put out to entertain children and toddlers. “I don’t wanna talk about it guys” cries the man, 
knocking his cup of vegan water over. I try to reassure him that everyone has bad luck now and then,
but he just ignores me, as always. This tavern attracts some strange types indeed.
