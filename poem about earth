I came across your playlist, and I am so happy because of that! The videos you have made really helped me understand Git & GitHub!

Here goes my poem:

Earth
You're so complex as well as beautiful
You contain all the different colors possible (also some we cant even see!)
You've been through many different time periods, and now you're witnessing what we humans refer to as 2020.
We love you earth, and hope you will be here for many more years.

Take care of the Earth (home)!

-Armin
