My Poem...........................

oh you , yes you 
dear rainbom coder
Please take care of our planet earth 
because who else would do

Try to be creative
while doing so 
and never let anyone 
tell you , you can't do

Learn something new
Teach something new
go get what you want
because even sky 
is not the limit

rainbow coder is great
you are making people life simple 
as anybody can't expect
last but not least
you are making us great
