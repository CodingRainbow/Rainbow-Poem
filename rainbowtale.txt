Once upon a time there was a rainbow.
The rainbow was so colorful and great and it was very nice and graceful rainbow and never wanted to hurt or offend other rainbows. 
Actually, the rainbow loved all creatures in the world and the world beyond this world but one. 
The unicorn! 
In some senses, the rainbow also didn’t like the ponies but not as bad as the unicorns, because they are quite cute and they are so small and cuddly.
The reason that the rainbow hated the unicorns so much was that the unicorns had taken the rainbow’s registered trademark, the colors, and made them their own! How rude!!
(I’m not sure how to continue this tale. Maybe I can get some help?) :)

The trademark issue was a legal one but there was more to the ill-feeling held by the rainbow towards the unicorns than that. When the rainbow thought of the beautiful colours of the unicorns it felt cold and sweaty, and a little of its own colours faded. It was reminded of a certain game it used to play with the wind when it brought the cool misty clouds...

All the best!
