Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow,wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
maybe even a bit below
spread the color of rainbow whrver you go
paint with rainbow,create a magnificent show 
open the faucet and let the rainbow flow
share rainbow with neighbour,family and friends
give the needy a helping hand,reach out and extend 
dance with rainbow,sing with rainbow 
eat with the rainbow, slide down the rainbow
let the rainbow shine through
