Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow,wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of rainbow whrver you go
paint with rainbow,create a magnificent show 
share rainbow with neighbour,family and friends
give the needy a helping hand,reach out and extend 
dance with rainbow,sing with rainbow 
let the rainbow shine through

I really like the above lines, I may be not so good but here are mine.

You know me?
Yes,
How many colors are there in me?
Two, as many of us(white and black)
You say you know me..
Don't I?
Not until you know the colors in me.
What are they?

Black White Gray
Purple Blue Indigo
Red
Along with 
Green and Yellow 
And don't forget the Orange
