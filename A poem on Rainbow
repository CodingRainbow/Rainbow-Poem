Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow,wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of rainbow whrver you go
paint with rainbow,create a magnificent show 
share rainbow with neighbour,family and friends
give the needy a helping hand,reach out and extend 
dance with rainbow,sing with rainbow 
let the rainbow shine through
Hey that is pretty good poem!
Sorry to destroy the completeness of it to do a pull request!
