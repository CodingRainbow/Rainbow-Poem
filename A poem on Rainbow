Here's a poem on Two Rainbows

play with rainbows, wear the rainbows
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of rainbows
paint with rainbows, create a magnificent show 
share rainbow with neighbour, family, and friends
give the needy rainbows
dance with rainbows, sing with rainbows
let the rainbows shine through
