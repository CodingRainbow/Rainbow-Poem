Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow, wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
see a rainbow, catch a rainbow
spread the color of rainbow wherever you go
paint with rainbow, color with rainbow
you can create a magnificent show 
dance with rainbow,sing with rainbow 
let the rainbow in to let it go
