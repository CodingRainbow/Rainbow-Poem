Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow,wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the colors, shine and glow
and before you know it you've created a magnificent show 
share the rainbow with neighbour,family and friends
give the needy a helping hand,reach out and extend 
let kindness be the new trend
