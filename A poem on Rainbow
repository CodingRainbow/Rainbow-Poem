Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow, wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of rainbow wherever you go. 
paint with rainbow, create a magnificent show 
share rainbow with neighbours, families and friends
give the needy a helping hand, reach out and extend 
dance with the rainbow, sing with the rainbow 
let the rainbow shine through!
