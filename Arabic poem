A bit of a life
I probably didâ€”

observe one day

the fall of the sun
and caught the gold that was scattered
in the palm of the sea
and enclosed my ribs about
the last escaping heat
as I searched for a farewell
sifting through piles of sand

And I paced the city
back and forth
I hung around in the old cafes
sipping at bottles of beer
I met with friends and passers-by
sat with literati and revolutionaries
and among the crowded tables I spent
long hours

I went up and down
streets and discussions
but I remember that once
I bought
from the other end of the street
a mizmar!
And I stood under a balcony
observing wet newspapers
and the heavy clothes
shifting my feet
in a puddle
making endless circles
