Crutching her back, half bent half squatting.
Feet screeching, she walks on
Her young frame weakened by the young life.
Tears welling down the cheeks she mourns
She curses the day, barely two months.

Tossing her mind to the harsh mother,
To unreasonable dad, the traitorous mate.
She can't understand why the world had turned this cruel.
No love, no care. Scolds and denial.

Fourteen years of life had been good,
What came between?
Only a pill away from love and happiness.
Tears will wash away the guilt she assures
The loathsome barrier from mates and family
to the bin but guilt engraves, her heart, its home.

She walks to school, guilt written on the young face.
With growing days grows her sorrows,
haunts of the creature's spirit
Regrets not living with the mistake
On the noose, seeks consolation.
The world mourns life lost through the life lost to stigma.
