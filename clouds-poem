I see clouds of   words
I see clouds of   lâ™¥ve
I see clouds of   pain
I see clouds   that hurt
I see clouds of  shame
I see clouds of   time
I see clouds of   the past
I see clouds of  rain
I see clouds of  thunder
I see clouds   that teach us all
I see clouds of   things to give
I see clouds of  things to take
I see clouds in   my mind
I see clouds of   given time
I see clouds of   hell
I see clouds of   hate
I see clouds of   to celebrate
I see clouds of   lost in space

I see clouds of*   ME
